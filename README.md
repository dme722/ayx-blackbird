## What is it?
`ayx-blackbird` is a package for building new tools for [Alteryx Designer](https://www.alteryx.com/designer-trial/free-trial?&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Demgen-Mixed-Brand_New&utm_term=alteryx%20designer&gclid=CjwKCAiAjrXxBRAPEiwAiM3DQlrvZhb2QftEwjdOIkT7rhunlaipoaT4wiFn7GsEuDrqmnj7eMNL2RoCY-oQAvD_BwE) in Python.

Alteryx Designer is equipped with a [Python SDK](https://help.alteryx.com/developer/current/Python/Overview.htm). This SDK is quite powerful, however it is convoluted and difficult to use for newcomers.

`ayx-blackbird` is an abstraction layer for the Python SDK that compromises on neither ease of use nor performance.

## Main Features
- A suite of example tools to get you off the ground.
- CLI tools to set up your tool directory structure, assist with development, and package [YXIs](https://help.alteryx.com/developer/current/PackageTool.htm?tocpath=SDKs%7CBuild%20Custom%20Tools%7C_____7).
- An extremely flexible development platform that by default, allows extremely fast development of new tools, and with small modifications, extremely fast performance.
